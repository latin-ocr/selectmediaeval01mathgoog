into a wellordered account. The student, after he has mado
his report upon the facts contained in the material, may very ’
well be asked to construet a chapter dealing with the matter
as a whole. ¹By suche method the evils attendant upon
mere recitation or lecture work will be largely avoided, and
a new sense of, reality will be given to the entire period

In the study of treaties it will be advisable to get ¹

accurately the actual conditions existing before the contest-
began which resulted iu¹ the treaty, and then to compare

them with the terms fixed by the document itselt. Per· Ι

haps this comparison is the most valuable use to which a
treaty can be put, but in addition there should be noticed
not only the' method of guaranteeing its various stipulatione,
but also the transfer of political rights, and above all, tho
emergence of the power of the municipalities. It may often
be advisable to compare various treaties in which the con-
tracting powers represent approximately the same political
elements. Above all, will the study of the treaty of Con·

stanee open up the heart of the great periods which it* ,

closed and opened.

It is a pleasure to acknowledge my indobtedness to Pro-
¹sessor 0. J. Thatcher for suggestions and corrections, and
to Professor Willard K. Clement, for his revision of the
text and for the glossarios which, it is hoped, will give new

value to the volume.

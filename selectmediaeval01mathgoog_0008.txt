cially illustratos the literary method of the period, while,
on the other hand, it has not seemed necessary to give
all the donations and caths of the Empemm, or all repe· ·
titicus of excommunication in the case of Frederich Il.

While otherwise only those Peaces and treaties have
been selected that closed an important struggle or
marked a decided advance in the relations between the
Popes and Emperors‚ the Peace ¹of Constance has been
added in an appendix because oi its great importante
in the history of the Italian cities. In general, how-
ever, only such selections have been admitted as illus-
trate the causes and growth of the three main issues.

In addition to the works mentioned in the text and
’ in the list below, Richter's Annalea dar deutschen 'Ga-
aahiahte im Malaita, and the various Jatrtaeter of
the Historical Commission, have been of special service.

If the study of these selections should awaken the
desire for a better acquaintance with the Annalists of
the Middle Ages‚ the school edition oi the Monameata
the Saaiptoaaa Raram Germanicarum, is recommended
as both critical and inexpensive. Students will find
great help in a work like Dahlmann's Urkaadaabacb,
edited by Waitz.

It will be seen that most of the selections are from
the Monamaata Germaniae Historiam J affe’s Bibliotheca
Raram Germanicarum, Huillard·Breholles' Historia Di-
ploatatiaa Fradarici II. Τὴθ text at least, therefore, is

worthy of confidence.

The compiler is greatly indebted to Mr. Norman L.
Bassett for help in reading proci.
